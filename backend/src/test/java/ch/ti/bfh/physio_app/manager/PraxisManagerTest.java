/**
 * Created by Jonas on 06.05.2017.
 *  * Important! Since we use Junit on this level of testing, we can't actually check what will happen in the real programm later.
 * We can only check if the desired method of our EntityManger is called and how many times. Nevertheless it is a good way to test
 * the behaviour of our methods.
 *
 * If desired, we will test on another level with another test environment.
